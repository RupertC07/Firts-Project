# Firts-Project
My first project in programming hero

This was actrually my very first project as an aspirang dev, it was way way bac 2020. 
Yeah, Im still suc in designing but bro, I've come a long way in my dev journey.
I'm a little more proud of myself now lol, thanfully backend exist.
As I writing this stuff, I realized something, I really love developing.
I don't want this to be cheesy but this project reminded me rn, in the middle
of my fight against laziness, to not stop learniing and developing and always giving your 
best shots regardless of what the project you are woring on.
